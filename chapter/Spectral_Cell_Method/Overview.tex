What is the main idea of the SCM in a nutshell?
How does it differ from the previous methods?
What are the main challenges to be solved?

Expand:

The SCM is based on the FCM but uses basis functions and integration schemes
of the SEM in order to partially diagonalize the mass matrix. Cells that are
located entirely in the physical domain are handled identically as in the SEM.
However, integrating cut cells using methods from the FCM leads to non-zero
off-diagonal components in the mass matrix. The main challenge is to
robustly handle cut cells such that the resulting mass matrix remains diagonal.
Considered methods that attempt to tackle this problem are described in this
chapter.
