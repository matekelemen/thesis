What impact does this thesis have? How and where can its results be used?
Find FE applications which inherently need a lot of time steps and most computational time is spent there, or which otherwise benefit from explicit time integration. I am probably restricted to linear models since nonlinear ones will spend much more time updating their structural matrices than performing time steps.
Examples:
Full waveform inversion.
