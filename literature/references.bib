	Abstract = {Hip fracture, which is often due to osteoporosis or other conditions affecting bone strength, can lead to permanent disability, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and/or death. Great effort has been directed toward developing noninvasive methods for evaluating proximal femoral strength (fracture load), with the goal of assessing fracture risk. Previously, computed tomographic scan-based, linear finite element (FE) models were used to estimate proximal femoral fracture loads ex vivo in two load configurations, one approximating joint loading during single-limb stance and the other simulating impact from a fall. Measured and computed fracture loads were correlated (stance, r=0.867; fall, r=0.949). However, precision for the stance configuration was insufficient to identify subjects with below average fracture loads reliably. The present study examined whether, for this configuration, nonlinear FE models could be used to identify these subjects. These models were found to predict fracture load within $\pm$2.0 kN (r=0.962). This level of precision is sufficient to identify 97.5% of femora with fracture loads 1.3 standard deviations below the mean as having below average fracture loads. Accordingly, 20% of subjects with below average fracture loads, i.e. those with the lowest fracture loads and likely to be at greatest risk of fracture, would be correctly identified with at least 97.5% reliability. This FE modeling method will be a powerful tool for studies of hip fracture.},

	Abstract = {Hip fracture is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly. Current methods of assessing a patient's risk of hip fracture involve local estimates of bone density (densitometry), and are limited by their inability to account for the complex structural features of the femur. In an effort to improve clinical and research tools for assessing hip fracture risk, this study investigated whether automatically generated, computed tomographic (CT) scan-based finite element (FE) models can be used to estimate femoral fracture load in vitro. Eighteen pairs of femora were examined under two loading conditions --- one similar to loading during the stance phase of gait, and one simulating impact from a fall. The femora were then mechanically tested to failure and regression analyses between measured fracture load and FE-predicted fracture load were performed. For comparison, densitometry measures were also examined. Significant relationships were found between measured fracture load and FE-predicted fracture load (r"0.87, stance; r"0.95, fall; r"0.97, stance and fall data pooled) and between measured fracture load and densitometry data (r"0.78, stance; r"0.91, fall). These results indicate that this sophisticated technique, which is still early in its development, can achieve precision comparable to that of densitometry and can predict femoral fracture load to within !40% to #60% with 95% confidence. Therefore, clinical use of this approach, which would require additional X-ray exposure and expenditure for a CT scan, is not justified at this point. Even so, the potential advantages of this CT/FE technique support further research in this area. },

	Abstract = {Hip fracture is a serious and common injury that can lead to permanent disability, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and death. Research to help prevent these fractures is essential. Computed tomographic (CT) scan-based finite element (FE) modeling is a tool that can predict proximal femoral fracture loads in vitro. Because this tool might be used in vivo, this study examined whether FE models generated from CT scans in situ and in vitro yield comparable predictions of proximal femoral fracture load. CT scans of the left proximal femur of two human cadavers were obtained in situ and in vitro, and three-dimensional FE models employing nonlinear mechanical properties were generated from each CT scan. The models were evaluated under single-limb stance-type loading by applying displacements incrementally to the femoral head. The FE-predicted fracture load (FFE) was the maximum femoral head reaction force. FFE for the in situ-derived models for the two subjects were 5.2 and 13.3% greater than for the in vitro-derived models. These results demonstrate that using CT scan data obtained in situ instead of in vitro to generate FE models can lead to substantially different predicted fracture loads. This effect must be considered when using this technology in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series {\_}The Art of Computer Programming{\_} covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from random number generators to floating point operations and other optimized arithmetic algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously written, this book (and series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work of authoritative scholarship in classical computer science, but one that can be read and used profitably by virtually all working programmers.  The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some knowledge of calculus.  Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable for college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's library.},

@article{Yosibash2007a,
	Abstract = {The prediction of patient-specific proximal femur mechanical response to various load conditions is of major clinical importance in orthopaedics. This paper presents a novel, empirically validated high-order finite element method (FEM) for simulating the bone response to loads. A model of the bone geometry was constructed from a quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) scan using smooth surfaces for both the cortical and trabecular regions. Inhomogeneous isotropic elastic properties were assigned to the finite element model using distinct continuous spatial fields for each region. The Young's modulus was represented as a continuous function computed by a least mean squares method. p-FEMs were used to bound the simulation numerical error and to quantify the modeling assumptions. We validated the FE results with in-vitro experiments on a fresh-frozen femur loaded by a quasi-static force of up to 1500  N at four different angles. We measured the vertical displacement and strains at various locations and investigated the sensitivity of the simulation. Good agreement was found for the displacements, and a fair agreement found in the measured strain in some of the locations. The presented study is a first step toward a reliable p-FEM simulation of human femurs based on QCT data for clinical computer aided decision making.},

@article{Bayraktar2004,
	Abstract = {The ability to determine trabecular bone tissue elastic and failure properties has biological and clinical importance. To date, trabecular tissue yield strains remain unknown due to experimental difficulties, and elastic moduli studies have reported controversial results. We hypothesized that the elastic and tensile and compressive yield properties of trabecular tissue are similar to those of cortical tissue. Effective tissue modulus and yield strains were calibrated for cadaveric human femoral neck specimens taken from 11 donors, using a combination of apparent-level mechanical testing and specimen-specific, high-resolution, nonlinear finite element modeling. The trabecular tissue properties were then compared to measured elastic modulus and tensile yield strain of human femoral diaphyseal cortical bone specimens obtained from a similar cohort of 34 donors. Cortical tissue properties were obtained by statistically eliminating the effects of vascular porosity. Results indicated that mean elastic modulus was 10% lower (p<0.05) for the trabecular tissue (18.0$\pm$2.8GPa) than for the cortical tissue (19.9$\pm$1.8GPa), and the 0.2% offset tensile yield strain was 15% lower for the trabecular tissue (0.62$\pm$0.04% vs. 0.73$\pm$0.05%, p<0.001). The tensile--compressive yield strength asymmetry for the trabecular tissue, 0.62 on average, was similar to values reported in the literature for cortical bone. We conclude that while the elastic modulus and yield strains for trabecular tissue are just slightly lower than those of cortical tissue, because of the cumulative effect of these differences, tissue strength is about 25% greater for cortical bone.},

	Abstract = {A two-level micromechanical model of cortical bone based on a generalized self-consistent method was developed to take into consideration the transversely isotropic elasticity of many microstructural features in cortical bone, including Haversian canals, resorption cavities, and osteonal and interstitial lamellae. In the first level, a single osteon was modeled as a two-phase composite such that Haversian canals were represented by elongated pores while the surrounding osteonal lamellae were considered as matrix. In the second level, osteons and resorption cavities were modeled as multiple inclusions while interstitial lamellae were regarded as matrix. The predictions of cortical bone elasticity from this two-level micromechanical model were mostly in agreement with experimental data for the dependence of transversely isotropic elasticity of human femoral cortical bone on porosity. However, variation in cortical bone elastic constants was greater in experimental data than in model predictions. This could be attributed to variations in the elastic properties of microstructural features in cortical bone. The present micromechanical model of cortical bone will be useful in understanding the contribution of cortical bone porosity to femoral neck fractures. },

	Abstract = {The relevance of Finite-Element models for hip fracture prediction should be increased by the recent subject-specific methods based on computed tomography (CT-scan), regarding the geometry as well as the material properties. The present study focused on the prediction of subject-specific mechanical parameters of cortical bone (Young's modulus and ultimate strength) from the bone density measured by CT. A total of 46 compression and 46 tension samples from 13 donors (mean age$\pm$S.D.: 81.8$\pm$12.7 years) were harvested in the femoral mid-diaphysis and tested until failure. The Young's modulus and ultimate strength were linearly correlated with the bone density measured by CT, for tension as well as compression (0.43<r2<0.72, p<0.001). To take into account the remaining uncertainties on the mechanical properties prediction, the standard error of the estimate (S.E.E.) was evaluated in each case (2694--2788MPa for Young's modulus, 13--16MPa for ultimate strength). The significant correlations obtained in the present study and the quantification of the errors will be helpful for the assessment of the cortical mechanical properties from the CT-scan data in order to create subject-specific FE-models.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the relationships between trabecular bone compressive strength and elastic modulus and the directly measured apparent density and noninvasively measured CT equivalent mineral density for 49 cylindrical specimens harvested from fresh human proximal femora. Compressive strength demonstrated a high positive correlation with both densities, being proportional to the apparent density raised to the 1.8 power (R2 = 0.93) and equivalent mineral density to the 1.5 power (R2 = 0.89). Similarly, the compressive modulus demonstrated a high correlation with both density measures, being proportional to the apparent density raised to the 1.4 power (R2 = 0.91) and CT equivalent mineral density to the 1.2 power (R2 = 0.90). Though variations in architecture and bone marrow fat were observed to influence trabecular properties, the data presented here demonstrate that apparent density, compressive strength, and elastic modulus can be determined accurately using single energy quantitative CT. We expect that the use of these noninvasive data will result in improved estimates of that component of hip fracture risk that is attributable to bone strength.},

@article{Ziouposa2008,
	Abstract = {Density is a salient property of bone and plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties of both its cancellous and cortical structural forms. Density is defined in a number of ways at either the bone tissue (Dapp, apparent) or the bone material level (Dmat, material). The concept of density is relatively simple, but measuring it in the context of bone is a complex issue. The third dimension of the problem is the concept of porosity, or BV/TV (ratio of bone material volume over tissue volume). Recent investigations from our laboratory have revealed an interdependence of Dapp and Dmat in the cancellous bone of at least four different cohorts of human patients. To clarify the underlying causes of this behaviour, we produced here equivalent relationships from specimens originating from cortical and cancellous areas of the same bone. Plots of Dapp vs. Dmat showed that Dmat was not a monotonic function of increasing Dapp, but instead showed a 'boomerang'-like pattern. By empirically dissecting the data in two regions for Dapp above and below a value equal to 1.3g/ccm, we were able to objectively isolate the bone in trabecular and compact forms. Our findings may have implications not only for the segregation of bone in these two structural forms, but also for the mechanobiological and physiological processes that govern the regulation of compact and trabecular bone areas.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze how the uncer- tainties in modelling the geometry and the material properties of a human bone affect the predictions of a finite-element model de- rived from computed tomography (CT) data. A sensitivity anal- ysis, based on a Monte Carlo method, was performed using three femur models generated from in vivo CT datasets, each subjected to two different loading conditions. The geometry, the density and the mechanical properties of the bone tissue were considered as random input variables. Finite-element results typically used in biomechanics research were considered as statistical output vari- ables, and their sensitivity to the inputs variability assessed. The results showed that it is not possible to define a priori the influ- ence of the errors related to the geometry definition process and to the material assignment process on the finite-element analysis results. The errors in the geometric representation of the bone are always the dominant variables for the stresses, as was expected. However, for all the variables, the results seemed to be dependent on the loading condition and to vary from subject to subject. The most interesting result is, however, that using the proposed method to build a finite-element model of a femur from a CT dataset of the quality typically achievable in the clinical practice, the coefficients of variation of the output variables never exceed the 9%. The pre- sented method is hence robust enough to be used for investigating the mechanical behavior of bones with subject-specific finite-ele- ment models derived from CT data taken in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Probabilistic analysis methods are being increasingly applied in the orthopaedics and biomechanics literature to account for uncertainty and variability in subject geometries, properties of various structures, kinematics and joint loading, as well as uncertainty in implant alignment. As a complement to experiments, finite element modelling, and statistical analysis, probabilistic analysis provides a method of characterizing the potential impact of variability in parameters on performance. This paper presents an overview of probabilistic analysis and a review of biomechanics literature utilizing probabilistic methods in structural reliability, kinematics, joint mechanics, musculoskeletal modelling, and patient-specific representations. The aim of this review paper is to demonstrate the wide range of applications of probabilistic methods and to aid researchers and clinicians in better understanding probabilistic analyses.},

	Abstract = {Finite element (FE) models of bone, developed from computed tomography (CT) scan data, are used to evaluate stresses and strains, load transfer and fixation of implants, and potential for fracture. The experimentally derived relationships used to transform CT scan data in Hounsfield unit to modulus and strength contain substantial scatter. The scatter in these relationships has potential to impact the results and conclusions of bone studies. The objectives of this study were to develop a computationally efficient probabilistic FE-based platform capable of incorporating uncertainty in bone property relationships, and to apply the model to a representative analysis; variability in stresses and fracture risk was predicted in five proximal femurs under stance loading conditions. Based on published variability in strength and modulus relationships derived in the proximal femur, the probabilistic analysis predicted the distributions of stress and risk. For the five femurs analyzed, the 1 and 99 percentile bounds varied by an average of 17.3 MPa for stress and by 0.28 for risk. In each femur, the predicted variability in risk was greater than 50% of the mean risk calculated, with obvious implications for clinical assessment. Results using the advanced mean value (AMV) method required only seven analysis trials (1 h) and differed by less than 2% when compared to a 1000-trial Monte-Carlo simulation (400 h). The probabilistic modeling platform developed has broad applicability to bone studies and can be similarly implemented to investigate other loading conditions, structures, sources of uncertainty, or output measures of interest.},

	Abstract = {We used a three-point bending test to investigate the structural behavior of 123 rectangular flat plate specimens harvested from the metaphyseal shell of the cervical and intertrochanteric regions of five fresh/frozen human proximal remora. For comparison purposes, 36 specimens of similar geometry were also fabricated from bone of the femoral diaphysis. All specimens were oriented in either the local longitudinal or transverse directions. The mean longitudinal elastic modulus was 9650+2410(SD) MPa and demonstrated a 24% decrease from that measured for the diaphysis (12500+- 2140 MPa) using the same testing technique. However, the transverse elastic moduli did not differ significantly between the proximal (547+- 1720 MPa) and diaphyseal(5990 +- 1520 MPa) specimens. The globally averaged values for the ultimate tensile strengths of the metaphyseal shell were 101+26 MPa in the longitudinal and 50+ 12MPa in the transverse directions. These compared with diaphyseal values of 128+ 16 MPa and 47 & 12 MPa, respectively. While these differences were largely due to the reduced density of the proximal specimens, a slight decrease in transverse anisotropy for the proximal specimens was also noted by comparing the ratio of longitudinal to transverse moduli (1.76)and tensile strength (2.02)to the diaphyseal values (2.09and 2.71,respectively). Use of these data should lead to improved performance of analytical models for the proximal femur, and thus help focus increased attention on the structural contributions of trabecular bone to the strength and rigidity of the proximal femur.},

	Abstract = {Pathologic fracture of the hip due to metastatic lesions in bone is a serious problem. This study examined the effect of metastatic lesions on the material properties and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) data of trabecular bone. Twelve distal femora were obtained, four with lytic and/or blastic metastatic lesions (group L), four without lesions but from donors who died from breast, prostate, or lung cancer (group NL), and four from donors with no cancer (group NC). Each specimen was CT scanned, and 56, 15 x 15 x 15-mm cubes of trabecular bone were cut. QCT density (rQCT), compressive elastic modulus (E), compressive yield and ultimate strengths (Sy and Su), and ash density (rash) of each cube were determined. Regression analysis was performed between rash and E, Sy, Su and rQCT, and analysis of covariance was used to identify differences between groups. Power relationships that did not depend on group (p>0.1) were found between E and rash (0.74 < r < 0.84; p<0.001) and between strength (Sy and Su) and rash (r>0.94; p<0.001). rash was strongly related to rQCT (r>0.99; p<0.001). These results indicate that metastatic disease does not significantly impair the ability of QCT to provide an accurate and precise estimate of rash that can be used to estimate mechanical properties of trabecular bone with and without metastases.},

	Abstract = {Breast, prostate, lung, and other cancers can metastasize to bone and lead to pathological fracture. To lay the groundwork for new clinical techniques for assessing the risk of pathological fracture, we identified relationships between density measured using quantitative computed tomography (rQCT), longitudinal mechanical properties, and ash density (rAsh) of cortical bone from femoral diaphyses with and without metastatic lesions from breast, prostate, and lung cancer (bone with metastases from six donors; bone without metastases from one donor with cancer and two donors without cancer). Moderately strong linear relationships between rQCT and elastic modulus, strength, and rAsh were found for bone with metastases (0.73 < r < 0.93, P < 0.05). After accounting for differences in rQCT, the elastic modulus, compressive strength, tensile yield strain, and rAsh of bone with metastatic lesions differed from those of bone from donors without cancer (P < 0.01). However, differences in tensile strength or compressive yield strain, after controlling for rQCT, were not found. Thus, these cancers degrade the elastic modulus and compressive strength, but not the tensile strength, of cortical bone beyond the amount that would be expected from decreased density alone. The rQCT- mechanical property relationships reported may be useful for evaluating bone integrity and assessing the risk of fracture of bone with metastases.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative computed tomography based finite element analysis of the femur is currently being investi- gated as a method for non-invasive stiffness and strength predictions of the proximal femur. The specific objective of this study was to determine better conversion relationships from QCT-derived bone density to elastic modulus, in order to achieve accurate predictions of the overall femoral stiffness in a fall- on-the-hip loading configuration. Twenty-two femurs were scanned, segmented and meshed for finite element analysis. The elastic moduli of the elements were assigned according to the average density in the element. The femurs were then tested to fracture and force--displacement data were collected to calculate femoral stiffness. Using a training set of nine femurs, finite element analyses were performed and the parameters of the density--elastic modulus relationship were iteratively adjusted to obtain opti- mal stiffness predictions in a least-squares sense. The results were then validated on the remaining 13 femurs. Our novel procedure resulted in parameter identification of both power and sigmoid functions for density--elastic modulus conversion for this specific loading scenario. Our in situ estimated power law achieved improved predictions compared to published power laws, and the sigmoid function yielded even smaller prediction errors. In the future, these results will be used to further improve the femoral strength predictions of our finite element models.},

	Abstract = {Background: The mechanical response of patient-specific bone to various load conditions is of major clinical importance in orthopedics. Herein we enhance the methods presented in Yosibash et al. [2007. A CT-based high-order finite element analysis of the human proximal femur compared to in-vitro experiments. ASME Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 129(3), 297--309.] for the reliable simulations of the human proximal femur by high-order finite elements (FEs) and validate the simulations by experimental observations.
Method of approach: A fresh-frozen human femur was scanned by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and thereafter loaded (in vitro experiments) by a quasi-static force of up to 1250 N. QCT scans were manipulated to generate a high-order FE bone model with distinct cortical and trabecular regions having inhomogeneous isotropic elastic properties with Young's modulus represented by continuous spatial functions. Sensitivity analyses were performed to quantify parameters that mostly influence the mechanical response. FE results were compared to displacements and strains measured in the experiments.
Results: Young moduli correlated to QCT Hounsfield Units by relations in Keyak and Falkinstein [2003. Comparison of in situ and in vitro CT scan-based finite element model predictions of proximal femoral fracture load. Medical Engineering and Physics 25, 781--787.] were found to provide predictions that match the experimental results closely. Excellent agreement was found for both the displacements and strains. The presented study demonstrates that reliable and validated high-order patient-specific FE simulations of human femurs based on QCT data are achievable for clinical computer-aided decision making.},

	Abstract = {The principal objectives of this study were to determine the mathematical dependency of the compressive mechanical properties of human bone on several commonly used measures of bone composi- tion, and to assess variations in this dependency based upon the composition range spanned by the data. Destructive mechanical tests were conducted along the superior-inferior axis of 496 cubic specimens of human trabecular and cortical bone from five male donors (ages 46-84 yr), including specimens from lumbar vertebrae and femoral metaphyses and diaphyses. There was over a 3OCO-fold variation in strength (S, ultimate stress) and over a 20,OQO-fold variation in stiffness (E, elastic modulus) over the range of apparent dry density (pa=0.05-1.89 gcne3), apparent ash density (p==O.O3-1.22 gem-j) and mineral content (c(= 17.4-66.2%) examined. Both linear and power models produced very high correlations (R2>0.81) between mechanical properties and bone composition, but the linear models resulted in a much greater percent deviation (PD) of the predicted dependent variable with respect to the measured value, in comparison to power models. The best correlations were obtained using p, as the only

Using a subset of the data based upon an apparent dry density range of 0.22<p,c 1.89 gcme3, it was possible to obtain a mathematical relationship in which bone stiffness and strength were precisely proportional to the cube and square, respectively. of the apparent dry density. These results indicate that the mathematical dependency of bone compressive mechanical properties on composition is closely dependent upon the density and mineral content range examined and, in terms of a single compositional measure, is best predicted by apparent ash density expressed as a power function.},

This paper presents a reliability tool to be integrated into the SOFiSTiK finite element software package. SOFiSTiK is a powerful program that encompasses a variety of finite elements as well as meshing and CAD modules. The reliability tool is programmed in a separate module while the interaction is established by communication with the core's database. The tool includes FORM ap- proximation with robust optimization algorithms and a variety of simulation techniques, including importance and directional Monte Carlo integration of the failure domain. The representation of the response surface with a polynomial meta-model is also included. The paper discusses the reliability methods and gives examples to verify their applicability to industrial problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an application of the subset simulation method to the finite element reliability assessment of a deep circular tunnel. The tunnel is assumed to be surrounded by weak rock with uncertain material properties. For the spatial variability of the uncertain parameters the midpoint method is utilized. Depending on the assumed correlation length, the above stochastic discretization method may lead to a very large number of random variables. In such cases, most Monte Carlo variants prove to be inefficient in computing small failure probabilities, which are typical in structural engineering. How- ever, the subset simulation method overcomes this problem by expressing the failure probability as a product of larger conditional probabilities, which are es- timated by applying an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. The re- liability analysis is performed using a reliability tool, which is being developed as part of the SOFiSTiK finite element software package.},

	Abstract = {
In this paper the need for a rational treatment of uncertainties in structural mechanics and analysis is reasoned. It is shown that the traditional deterministic conception can be easily extended by applying statistical and probabilistic concepts. The so-called Monte Carlo simulation procedure is the key for those developments, as it allows the straightforward use of the currently used deterministic analysis procedures.
A numerical example exemplifies the methodology. It is concluded that uncertainty analysis may ensure robust predictions of variability, model verification, safety assessment, etc.},

@article{Foo2007,
	Abstract = {
We investigate three-dimensional problems in solid mechanics with stochastic loading or material properties. To solve these problems, we use a spectral expansion of the solution and random inputs based on Askey-type orthogonal polynomials in terms of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables. A Galerkin procedure using these types of expansions, the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method, is employed to solve linear elasticity problems. An analagous spectral collocation formulation is used to study problems in nonlinear elasticity. These methods both cast the stochastic problem as a coupled or decoupled high-dimensional system of deterministic PDEs, which is then solved numerically using a deterministic p-finite element solver. We present algorithms for solving certain coupled systems arising from the stochastic Galerkin projection without modifying the original deterministic solver. Three-dimensional riser-sections undergoing elastic deformations due to random pressure loads are considered. We also model a riser-section with stochastic Young's modulus undergoing deterministic loads. It is demonstrated that the gPC method provides accurate and efficient results at a speed-up factor of two and three orders of magnitude compared to traditional Monte-Carlo simulations. For nonlinear problems, the stochastic collocation method is also shown to be much faster than Monte-Carlo simulation, while still rivaling this method in simplicity of implementation.},

	Abstract = {
This article presents a generalization of the recently proposed finite cell method to three-dimensional problems of linear elasticity. The finite cell method combines ideas from embedding or fictitious domain methods with the p-version of the finite element method. Besides supporting a fast, simple generation of meshes it also provides high convergence rates. Mesh generation for a boundary representation of solids and for voxel-based data obtained from CT scans is addressed in detail. In addition, the implementation of non-homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and the computation of cell matrices based on a composed integration is presented. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by three numerical examples, including the elastostatic computation of a human bone biopsy.},
